            <p>
                Individual groups on Case Root which are called Roots may have their own rules in addition to ours (as long as they don't break ours) and their own moderators to enforce them.
                Case Root provides tools to aid moderators but does not prescribe their usage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please, note that Roots on Case Root are not owned by its moderators. They're just being moderated by them.
                This means even though we do our best not to interfere, we still have the right to take over
                a channel to take necessary actions if needed. We usually do this when a channel has lack of
                available moderator to add new ones.
